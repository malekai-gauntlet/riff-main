# Video Loading Optimization Checklist

## Current Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Three Active Videos Implementation
1. **Modify Video Management Structure**
   - [ ] Update `_VideoItem` to track active window status
   - [ ] Add window position tracking in `FeedScreen`
   - [ ] Implement sliding window logic in `PageView.builder`

2. **Controller Lifecycle Management**
   - [ ] Add immediate disposal for videos outside window
   - [ ] Implement preloading for next video
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup in dispose methods

3. **Window Position Tracking**
   - [ ] Track current, previous, and next indices
   - [ ] Update window on scroll/page change
   - [ ] Handle edge cases (first/last video)

4. **Memory Management**
   - [ ] Verify controller disposal
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage
   - [ ] Add debug logging for window movement

5. **Testing Steps**
   - [ ] Test smooth scrolling
   - [ ] Verify video loading timing
   - [ ] Check memory usage
   - [ ] Test on mobile device
   - [ ] Test different scroll speeds

### Phase 2: Progressive Loading Enhancement
1. **Thumbnail System**
   - [ ] Add thumbnail support to video model
   - [ ] Implement thumbnail preloading
   - [ ] Add placeholder UI

2. **Quality Transitions**
   - [ ] Implement low-quality initial load
   - [ ] Add smooth transition to high quality
   - [ ] Handle quality switching logic

3. **Loading States**
   - [ ] Add loading indicators
   - [ ] Implement transition animations
   - [ ] Handle error states

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize thumbnail loading
   - [ ] Cache quality versions
   - [ ] Fine-tune transition timing

## Original High Priority Tasks

## 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY - Core Performance Issues

- [ ] Implement power-saving mode

## Testing Process for Each Item
1. Implement the change
2. Deploy to production
3. Test on both desktop and mobile
4. Verify if the issue is improved
5. Document what worked/didn't work
6. Move to next item if needed
